# 5- Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute
# the area.

base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

area = 0.5 * base * height

print("Area of the triangle with base", base, "and height", height, "is:", area)
